        question: "How does machine learning differ from traditional programming?",
        answer: "Traditional programming involves explicitly providing instructions for a computer to follow, whereas machine learning enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. Machine learning algorithms improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data."

        question: "How does blockchain technology ensure security in digital transactions?",
        answer: "Blockchain technology ensures security in digital transactions through decentralization, cryptographic encryption, and immutability. Transactions are recorded in a decentralized ledger across multiple nodes, making it extremely difficult for a single entity to manipulate the data. Cryptographic techniques secure the integrity and confidentiality of transactions, while the immutability of the blockchain prevents tampering or altering of transaction records."
